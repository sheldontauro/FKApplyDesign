#How to run(Updated)

Run file TicTacToe.java

Choose which game you want to play.

Choose the actual board game size and the recursive size for the enhanced version of the game.

Enter the name of the first player.

Enter the name of the second player.

At the end of the game you will be the scoreboard of the players.

To mark a block -> Enter the coordinates(0 indexing)

once the game is over the result is declared

Note - to undo a move input "-1" in the x coordinate's place 

#Example

Terminal -> Enter the name of player 1

User -> name1

Terminal -> Enter the name of player 2

User -> name2

Terminal -> $Displays Empty Matrix$

Terminal -> name1 move(indicating it is name1's move)

User -> enters coordinates for the matrix(his move)

Terminal -> $Displays updated matrix$

#NOTE

If you use the name "machine"(Case sensitive) as the name for a player, the machine will play

--> In the hex game the board display is not very intuitive

--> In the connect four game you have to mention the exact cells where you would like to place the block(but if you try to place it in the wrong place a move-checker is kept in place)
